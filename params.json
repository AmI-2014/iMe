In fact the central computer will communicate to you all the needed informations through an application on your mobile phone, from which you'll be able to set checkpoints, paths, and locations for outdoor gaming. Anyway this doesn't end here! If you're nerd and proud of it, by using our ready-to-use hardware (a set of sensors and Raspberry PI) and adding a pair more settings, even indoor gaming will not be a limit. \r\n\r\n###                                  Get ready for the quest!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\niMe project developers:\r\n\r\n[Andrea Barbasso](https://github.com/AndreaBarbasso) - [Andrea Bistolfi](https://github.com/Bisto92) - [Filippo Galli](https://github.com/philipjk)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
